# calculator

### **Description**
This is a simple calculator application built as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum. The project demonstrates the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a functional calculator that supports both button and keyboard input.

---

### **Features**
- Perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulo.
- Handles floating-point numbers with precision up to 10 decimal places.
- Supports keyboard input for numbers, operators, and special keys like Enter, Backspace, and Escape.
- Dynamic button enabling/disabling to prevent invalid inputs (e.g., multiple dots in a number).
- responsive design with a clean and minimalist UI.

---

### **Technologies Used**
- **HTML5**: Markup for the calculator layout.
- **CSS3**: Styling with flexbox for responsive design.
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: Logic for handling calculations, keyboard events, and dynamic UI updates.

### **Lessons Learned**
- The importance of **modularizing code** to avoid redundancy and improve maintainability.
- Managing **keyboard and mouse inputs** seamlessly using event listeners.
- Handling **floating-point arithmetic** and edge cases.
